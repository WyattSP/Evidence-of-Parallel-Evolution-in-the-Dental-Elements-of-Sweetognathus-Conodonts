Code and data used in the study: Evidence of Parallel Evolution in the Dental Elements of Sweetognathus Conodonts

The provided code was run in R Studio (RStudio Team, 2020; Version 1.1.423) running R Software (R Core Team 2019; Version 3.6.2).

The data set required for analysis run in the main text is contained in the Sweetognathus.Outlines.rds file.

The data set required for analysis completed in the supplementary information section "Denticle Cross-Section Sensitivity Analysis" is contained in the Full_Data_OutlineSense.rds file.

I have also included the raw JPEG files computed using MeshLab of the denticle cross-sections. These can be imported and run in R Studio using the R-package Momocs. The provided data set Sweetognathus.Outlines.rds is simply the already imported outlines.
